*Read Through the Bible* is a Progressive Web App (PWA) to empower people who want to complete bible reading plans. A "bible reading plan" is a plan for reading, all of or part of, the Bible. The Bible Reading Plan App seeks to be a reference for the most popular bible reading plans. The Bible Reading Plan App also seeks to encourage and assist all people to read the Bible through bible reading plans. Without the assistance of technology, Bible reading plans are,

  - difficult to explore because there is no central repository
  - challenging and time consuming to create because of the vast amount of scripture
  - unfriendly to use day-in-day out sometimes requiring a rotating 4 to 10 bookmarks

However, there is great value in studying scripture. As Christians, the more we study the Bible, the more we abide in Christ and become aligned with God's perfect will as children of the light.

This project is working to establish a PWA that will provide people an enhanced ability to explore, create, and use Bible reading plans. The app will...

  - emphasis user experience of enhanced functionality
  - provide over access to many plans
  - provide a limited in-app scripture viewer to complete plan content
  - allow users to create their own plans
  - provide users with the ability to export plans to pdf
