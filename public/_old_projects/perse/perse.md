*PerSE* is a visual analytics web application for finding patterns in multi-calendar related coded news articles, and the outcome of my Master's Thesis at Penn State. 

> *Per &bull; SE*: **Per**iodicity in **S**patio-temporal **E**vents

PerSE is composed of filtering views: a map, attribute view, time-wheel, timeline, and table. Users interactively set and release filters on one or more of the views to detect and analyze periodicity within event data sets.
