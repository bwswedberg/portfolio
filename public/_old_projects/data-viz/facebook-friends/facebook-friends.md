This is a forced-directed graph of my facebook friends using the d3 library. This graph shows 470 nodes and 6,492 edges.

* node: a facebook friend; circle. 
* edge: a connection between a facebook friend that is also friends with one of my friends; line.

It's interesting that my wife is at the center of the graph. It seems that she has become a central node because of her involvement in my social life.
