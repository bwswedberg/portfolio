*Collapsible tree with minimap* shows how to implement a minimap for visualizations that require a lot of real estate--like trees or organization charts. In some cases, a minimap could prove useful in fulfilling [Ben Shneiderman's Visual Information Seeking Mantra](https://www.mat.ucsb.edu/g.legrady/academic/courses/11w259/schneiderman.pdf). D3.js data joining makes minimap implementation an easy task. 

Inspiration includes,

- [Minimap/Mini-viewer](https://blog.asmartbear.com/creativity-over-optimization.html) and later code editors like Atom's [Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap), Sublime, VSCode, and others
